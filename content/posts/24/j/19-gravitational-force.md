Force between two masses, also between mass and field, considered in butiran.

<!--more-->

When we talk about force between two masses at distance some terms come up, such gravity, gravitational force, and gravitation. Gravity is a real force but not in the traditional sense, because at fundamental level there are not any action-at-distance forces, since it just a mass creating gravitational field and then the other mass moving and interacting with this field [^baird_2022]. It is better to use the term gravitational force instead of gravity about the force between to masses that are not in contact [^gpt4o_2022]. Newton's law of universal gravitation usually present the force in scalar form [^henderson_2022], which is not easy to use for interaction more than to masses. The vector form [^bridge_2017] will be used here since it is more general and easier to use in calculating force superposition. There is also gravitional force on a mass in a gravitational field as weight of a mass is calculated near earth surface [^nasa_2022].

Mass $m_i$ will experience gravitational force

$$\tag{1}
\vec{G}_i = m_i \vec{g}
$$

in gravitational field $\vec{g}$, where source of gravitational field is catually another mass or another mass distribution.

Mass $m_i$ will experimence gravitational force

$$\tag{2}
\vec{G} _{ij} = -k_G \frac{m_i m_j}{r _{ij}^2} \hat{r} _{ij}
$$

due to existence of other mass $m_j$, where position of mass $m_i$ is $\vec{r}_i$ and position of mass $m_j$ is $\vec{r}_j$.

Relative position of mass $m_i$ from $m_j$ is

$$\tag{3}
\vec{r} _{ij} = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j,
$$

distance between two masses is

$$\tag{4}
r_{ij} = |\vec{r} _{ij}| = \sqrt{\vec{r} _{ij} \cdot \vec{r} _{ij}},
$$

and 

$$\tag{5}
\hat{r} _{ij} = \frac{\vec{r} _{ij}}{r _{ij}}
$$

is the unit vector.

From Eqn (1) and (2) it can be obtained

$$\tag{6}
\vec{g}_j(\vec{r}) = -k_G \frac{m_j}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j|^3} (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j)
$$

as gravitational field produced by mass $m_j$ experienced by another mass in the surrounding of mass $m_j$.
