Force between two masses, also between mass and field, considered in butiran.

<!--more-->

When we talk about force between two masses at distance some terms come up, such gravity, gravitational force, and gravitation. Gravity is a real force but not in the traditional sense, because at fundamental level there are not any action-at-distance forces, since it just a mass creating gravitational field and then the other mass moving and interacting with this field [^baird_2022]. It is better to use the term gravitational force instead of gravity about the force between to masses that are not in contact [^gpt4o_2022]. Newton's law of universal gravitation usually present the force in scalar form [^henderson_2022], which is not easy to use for interaction more than to masses.
