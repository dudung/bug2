Some infos about brain hack obtained this morning

<!--more-->

I do not really know about what brain hack is? This morning I find a YouTube video at TEDxHobart with title "6 secrets to learning faster, backed by neuroscience" presented by Lila Landowski [^landowski_2023]. I will watch it after arriving at the office, a technical institute or university, since it is about 18 minutes video. Now is 0514 and have to take someone to school.
